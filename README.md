# ðŸŒ± About me

Hi I am @FangTasticBeast and I am a highly enthusiastic programmer with high aspirations for every project I start.
I have been programming since mid 2017 in Roblox and Unity with a wide range of languages including ```Java```, ```Lua``` and ```C```. 
I am currently studying Computer Science in University with hopes to be moving into the game development industry once completed. 
Currently I am launching Open-Sourced projects to help developers on Roblox reach their full potential with features rarely or never seen before. Perth Australia (GMT+8)
